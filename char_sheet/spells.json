The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to convincingly mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion counts as a creature for flanking. It uses your spell roll for attack rolls and saving throws and your spell DC for its AC. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell is dismissed. The creature has two actions per turn, which it takes when you Concentrate on the spell. The illusion can't directly affect the physical world, though its attacks can cause damage by making the target believe they're real. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster--for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage-- the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. Wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it, for example. A program can be up to 1 minute long, and it repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a programmed scene of two orcs fighting each other, and their fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the fight and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends or begins.
