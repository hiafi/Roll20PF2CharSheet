Half-elves don't have their own homeland, nor are populations of half-elves particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate human and Elven heritages. Instead, most half-elves attempt to find acceptance in either human or Elven settlements. Half-elves often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded humans. Half-elves lack the almost alien eyes of their elf parents, though they do carry a natural presence--and often a striking beauty--that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many half-elves have difficulty forming lasting bonds with humans or elves due to the disconnection they feel from both peoples as a whole. Half-elves live longer than other humans, often reaching an age around 150 years. This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with humans, knowing that they'll likely outlive their companions."

Because some bigoted humans see orcs as more akin to creatures than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs to the margins of society, where some find work in drudgery or as mercenaries, and others tragically fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can't stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek out into the wilderness to live in peace. Humans often assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely find acceptance among societies with a large concentration of such folk. To an orc tribe, a half-orc is considered intelligent enough to make a good war leader but weaker than the other orcs. Consequently, many half-orcs end up having low status among orc tribes unless they can prove their strength. A half-orc has a shorter lifespan than other humans, living to be roughly 70 years old."
