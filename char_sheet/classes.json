The GM makes a flat check for each structure, determining the DC for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, or higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; any creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to escape it.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' b'<b>Success</b> Target takes half collapse damage and falls prone.\\r\\n' b'<b>Critical Success</b> Target takes half collapse damage.\\r\\n' b'<b>Failure</b> Target takes full collapse damage and falls prone.\\r\\n' b'<b>Critical Failure</b> Takes full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.\\r\\n' Your Quaking Stomp might have additional effects in certain types of terrain. For instance, a cliff might collapse, causing creatures atop it to fall, or a lake might drain as the fissures open up below its surface and leave a morass of quicksand.

Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for your Verbal Casting actions rather than speaking. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC.

For example, as a 1st-level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells.

You can also cast a composition power called counter performance that protects against auditory and visual effects. You have a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast this spell. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points during your daily preparations. You can cast counter performance only by spending 1 Spell Point, not using spell slots. This power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast.

      "text": "Choose one deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on Table 3a9: Deities on pages 72a73. This table lists each deity's name, areas of concern, and alignment, followed by the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in parentheses after the deity's alignment. Your deity grants you a signature skill and the trained proficiency rank with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. When preparing spells, you can select from these in addition to the spells on the divine list once you can cast that level of spell. Select one domainaa subject of particular interest to you within the traditions of your religionafrom your deity's list of domains. This domain grants you a special kind of spell called a domain power. Each domain's theme and powers appear in Table 3a10: Domains. By choosing a domain, you gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast domain powers. You can cast domain powers only by spending Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Your maximum number of Spell Points equals your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. You gain the initial power tied to your domain when you select the domain. Your initial domain power costs 1 Spell Point to cast and is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Domain powers are available only to characters who've selected the domain and can't be learned by others. Some cleric feats grant you more domain powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. You can learn additional powers, called advanced domain powers, by taking the Advanced Domain cleric feat. The Spell Point cost of this advanced domain power is listed in parentheses after its name in Table 3a10: Domains."

    "Anathema": {
      "text": "Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Committing acts, learning or casting spells, and using items that are anathema to your deity take you out of that deity's good graces. Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment."
    },
    "Cantrips": {
      "text": "A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to enhance your ability to lie would be anathema to a god or goddess of honesty, and casting one to create undead would be anathema to a god or goddess of life. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine whether other acts count as anathema. For example, actions that work to destroy a close-knit community are typically anathema to a god of community. However, if that god is also a god of dwarves, he might permit you to destroy a community of giants that is threatening to wipe out a dwarven settlement. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include channel energy, domain powers, and divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual."

This pool of energy allows you to cast either the heal spell (for positive energy) or the harm spell (for negative energy) a number of times per day equal to 3 plus your Charisma modifier without needing to prepare the spell in advance. All spells you cast in this way are heightened to the maximum spell level you can cast as a cleric."

At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Druid Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC.

For example, as a 1st-level druid, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells.

    "Key Terms": {
      "text": "You'll see the following key terms in many fighter abilities. b'<b>Enhancements</b>: Enhancements are additional effects applied to a Strike.\\r\\n' If your Strike doesn't deal damage, any enhancements do not apply. Some enhancements also require that you critically succeed at your attack in order to apply the enhancement. b'<b>Open</b>: Actions with this trait allow you to prepare your next Strike or to enter a stance, or sometimes to do both. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven&#8217;t used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.\\r\\n' b'<b>Press</b>: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects on a failure can be gained only if the action took a &#226;&#128;&#147;4 multiple attack penalty or worse. The effects that are added on a failure don&#8217;t apply on a critical failure.\\r\\n' If your press action succeeds or critically succeeds, but it deals no damage and causes no other effects (typically due to resistance), you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. b'<b>Stance</b>: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait. You can enter a stance only in encounter mode.\\r\\n' A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. b'<table>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<th>Feat</th>\\r\\n<th>Level</th>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n</thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Aggressive Shield</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Agile Grace</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Assisting Shot</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Blind-Fight</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Brutal Finish</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Brutish Shove</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Certain Strike</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Combat Grab</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Combat Reflexes</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Debilitating Shot</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Desperate Finisher</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Determination</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Disruptive</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Double Shot</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">4</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Double Slice</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Dual-Handed Assault</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">4</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Dueling Dance</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Dueling Parry</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Dueling Riposte</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Exotic Weapon Training</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">6</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Felling Strike</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Furious Focus</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Graceful Poise</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">16</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Guiding Finish</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Guiding Riposte</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Impossible Volley</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">18</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Improved Bravery</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">6</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Improved Brutish Shove</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">4</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Improved Combat Grab</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Improved Dueling Riposte</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Improved Reflexive Shield</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">16</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Improved Twin Riposte</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Incredible Aim</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Incredible Follow-Up</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Intimidating Strike</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Knockdown</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Mirror Shield</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Multishot Paragon</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">16</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Point-Blank Shot</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Positioning Assault</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Power Attack</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Quick Reversal</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">4</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Quick Shield Block</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Reactionary</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">20</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Reactive Shield</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Reeling Blow</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Reflexive Shield</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>Revealing Stab</td>\\r\\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">6</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n</tbody>\\r\\n</table>\\r\\n'  "

If your Strike doesn&#8217;t deal damage, any enhancements do not apply. Some enhancements also require that you critically succeed against your opponent in order to apply the enhancement.\\r\\n' b'<strong>Open:</strong> Actions with this trait allow you to prepare your next Strike or have you enter a stance, and sometimes do both. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven&#8217;t used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.\\r\\n' b'<strong>Stance:</strong> A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait. You can enter a stance only in encounter mode. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first.\\r\\n'"

      "text": "You have the power to cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace Material Casting actions with Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells, plus an extra 1st-level spell due to the power of your bloodline. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier."

A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level sorcerer, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells."

You choose these from the common spells on the spell list corresponding to your bloodline in this book, or from other spells on that spell list to which you gain access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot from Table 3a20, you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. So when you reach 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and at 4th level you select a 2nd-level spell. Each time you learn spells of a new spell level, your bloodline also grants you both a new spell and a new spell slot of that level. As with other spell slots, you can use this bonus slot to cast any spell, not just the one your bloodline gave you. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa."

These preconceptions have little bearing on reality, and you can easily do good deeds with demonic powers. Having a bloodline tied to creatures of a certain alignment doesn't have any effect on your own alignment unless you want it to; your magic is disconnected from its source.

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient tomes of lost magic to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader approach emphasizing the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth. b'<b>Key Ability</b> Intelligence<br><b>Hit Points</b> 6 plus your Constitution modifier\\r\\n' Proficiencies b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><b>Trained</b> Perception</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Saving Throws b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><b>Trained</b> Fortitude, Reflex</li>\\r\\n<li><b>Expert</b> Will</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Skills b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><b>Trained</b> a number of skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Weapons b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><b>Trained</b> the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and staff</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Armor b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><b>Trained</b> none</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Spells b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><b>Trained</b> arcane spell rolls and DCs and in attack rolls for arcane spells</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Signature Skills b'<ul>\\r\\n<li><a href=\"http://pf2playtest.opengamingnetwork.com/skills/arcana-int/\">Arcana</a></li>\\r\\n<li>Crafting</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Adventuring as a Wizard Players of wizard characters might approach gameplay in the following ways: b'<ul>\\r\\n<li>During combat, you likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful spells to incapacitate threatening foes and use your renewable cantrips when only weaker foes remain, letting the martial characters dispatch them. When your enemies pull out nasty tricks like invisibility or flight, you answer them with spells like glitterdust or earth bind , leveling the playing field for your allies.</li>\\r\\n<li>During social encounters, you provide a wellspring of knowledge and solve arguments using logic.</li>\\r\\n<li>In exploration mode, you locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of the various esoterica you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll somewhere that will make it easier to overcome.</li>\\r\\n<li>In downtime mode, you learn new spells, train to make yourself more versatile for future situations, and research all sorts of information that will come in handy in your continuing adventures. You likely craft magic items or scribe scrolls for your party as well, which leads you to spend time seeking new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even use downtime to forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Roleplaying a Wizard Dedicated students of arcane magic, wizards are respected for their intellect, preparedness, and depth of knowledge, and feared for the otherworldly powers at their command. If You're a Wizard, You Likely... b'<ul>\\r\\n<li>Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works&#226;&#128;&#148;magic in particular.</li>\\r\\n<li>Believe fervently in the superiority of your particular school of magic (if you&#8217;re a specialist) or in the fact that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you&#8217;re a universalist).</li>\\r\\n<li>Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on most other people. Getting it right matters to you.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' Others Probably... b'<ul>\\r\\n<li>Think you&#8217;re an arrogant snob who believes you&#8217;re smarter or better than others.</li>\\r\\n<li>Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls and demand that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it&#8217;s too late.</li>\\r\\n<li>Overestimate your capabilities, blaming you or giving you credit for things like the weather or crop yields, even if you don&#8217;t have magic that can affect those things, and asking you for spells or baubles that can help them get whatever they currently desire.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n' b'<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table 3&#226;&#128;&#147;21: Wizard Advancement</caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<th>Level</th>\\r\\n<th>Class Features</th>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n</thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>1</td>\\r\\n<td>Ancestry feat, arcane focus, arcane school, arcane spellcasting, background, initial proficiencies, spellbook</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>2</td>\\r\\n<td>Skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>3</td>\\r\\n<td>2nd-level spells, general feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>4</td>\\r\\n<td>Skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>5</td>\\r\\n<td>3rd-level spells, ability boosts, ancestry feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>6</td>\\r\\n<td>Skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>7</td>\\r\\n<td>4th-level spells, general feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>8</td>\\r\\n<td>Skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>9</td>\\r\\n<td>5th-level spells, ancestry feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>10</td>\\r\\n<td>Ability boosts, skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>11</td>\\r\\n<td>6th-level spells, general feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>12</td>\\r\\n<td>Expert spellcaster, skill feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>12</td>\\r\\n<td>7th-level spells, ancestry feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>14</td>\\r\\n<td>Skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>15</td>\\r\\n<td>8th-level spells, ability boosts, general feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>16</td>\\r\\n<td>Master spellcaster, skill feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>17</td>\\r\\n<td>9th-level spells, ancestry feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>18</td>\\r\\n<td>Skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>19</td>\\r\\n<td>Legendary spellcaster, general feat, skill increase</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>20</td>\\r\\n<td>Ability boosts, skill feat, wizard feat</td>\\r\\n</tr>\\r\\n</tbody>\\r\\n</table>\\r\\n' b'<h2><span id=\"Class_Features\">Class Features</span></h2>\\r\\n' You gain these abilities as a wizard.

At 1st level you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook, plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if"

As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown on the Wizard Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier."

      "text": "A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level wizard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells."

When you prepare your spells, you can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells. Each spell in the combination must be 1 or more spell levels below the slot's level and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effectaboth spells must either require a ranged attack roll, the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target. When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one target. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only humanoids or only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. Handle the resolution of a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell's target successfully saved against a combined spell, it would take the aSucceeda effect of each spell, and if it critically failed it would take the aCritical Failurea effect of both spells. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
